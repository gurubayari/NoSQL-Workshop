## Test Structure

Each test file follows a consistent structure:

```python
class TestClassName:
    def setup_method(self):
        """Set up test data and mocks"""
        
    def test_specific_workflow(self):
        """Test a specific end-to-end workflow"""
        with patch('api_module.APIClass') as mock_api:
            # Mock setup
            # Test execution
            # Assertions
```

## Key Testing Patterns

### 1. Comprehensive Mocking
All external dependencies are mocked to ensure tests are:
- Fast and reliable
- Independent of external services
- Focused on business logic validation

### 2. Workflow Validation
Tests validate complete workflows by:
- Simulating realistic user interactions
- Verifying data flow between components
- Checking error handling and edge cases

### 3. Performance Testing
Load simulation tests verify:
- System performance under concurrent operations
- Cache effectiveness and optimization
- Response time requirements

### 4. Data Consistency
Cross-service tests validate:
- Inventory management across cart and orders
- Session continuity across devices
- Cache invalidation and synchronization

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pytest
```

### Run All End-to-End Tests
```bash
python backend/tests/e2e/run_e2e_tests.py
```

### Run Individual Test Files
```bash
# User workflows
python -m pytest backend/tests/e2e/test_user_workflows.py -v

# Search functionality
python -m pytest backend/tests/e2e/test_search_functionality.py -v

# Comprehensive workflows
python -m pytest backend/tests/e2e/test_comprehensive_workflows.py -v
```

### Run Specific Test Methods
```bash
python -m pytest backend/tests/e2e/test_user_workflows.py::TestUserWorkflows::test_complete_shopping_workflow -v
```

## Test Output

The test runner provides comprehensive output including:
- Test execution summary
- Performance metrics
- Coverage validation
- Requirements mapping
- Detailed error reporting

Example output:

## Mocked Services

The tests mock the following services:
- **Authentication API**: User registration, login, token management
- **Product API**: Product catalog, search, details
- **Cart API**: Shopping cart operations
- **Order API**: Order creation and management
- **Review API**: Review CRUD operations
- **Search API**: Search and auto-complete
- **Chat API**: AI chat functionality
- **Analytics API**: Insights and recommendations

## Performance Benchmarks

The tests validate performance requirements:
- Search response time: < 200ms (cached), < 500ms (uncached)
- Cart operations: < 100ms
- Auto-complete suggestions: < 50ms
- Success rate: > 95% under load
- Cache hit rate: > 25% for search operations

## Data Consistency Validation

Tests verify consistency across:
- **DynamoDB**: User profiles, cart data, orders, chat history
- **DocumentDB**: Products, reviews, knowledge base, vector embeddings
- **ElastiCache**: Session data, search suggestions, API response cache

## Error Scenarios Tested

- Database connection failures
- Service unavailability
- Invalid input validation
- Inventory conflicts
- Authentication failures
- Network timeouts
- Cache misses

## Integration Points Validated

- API Gateway â†’ Lambda functions
- Lambda â†’ Database connections
- ElastiCache â†’ Session management
- DocumentDB â†’ Vector search
- Bedrock â†’ AI processing
- Cross-service data flow

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to be run in CI/CD pipelines to:
- Validate deployments
- Catch regressions
- Ensure system reliability
- Verify performance requirements

## Contributing

When adding new end-to-end tests:
1. Follow the existing test structure
2. Mock all external dependencies
3. Test complete workflows, not individual functions
4. Include error scenarios and edge cases
5. Validate performance requirements
6. Update this README with new test coverage
